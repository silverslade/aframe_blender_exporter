# Blender Exporter to A-Frame VR

This Blender add-on allows you to model your scene in Blender and export it to an A-Frame VR project with a single click. 
The generated sources can be modified manually according to your project needs and can use a baking process to use baked Lightmaps.

This is an open source project under MIT terms, so feel free to email me or ask for a pull request, or just offer me a coffe!

## Installation

+ Download the latest release version from [Itch.io](https://silverslade.itch.io/a-frame-blender-exporter)
+ Open Blender (2.83+)
+ Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install
+ Browse and choose the addon zip file
+ Enable the addon
+ Note: This addon requires the glTF Exporter 2.0 (Add-on version v1.2.75)
+ Note: If you want to use baked Lightmaps, it requires the Lightmapper Add-on, [The Lightmapper Add-on](https://github.com/Naxela/The_Lightmapper). You have to install it manually.

## How to use this A-Frame Blender Exporter

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/silverslade/aframe_blender_exporter/raw/master/images/main-window.png">
</p>


+ Open a new/existing blender scene.
+ Open the View3D window (`n` key) to show the export window.
+ Set up best settings for your scene
+ Click on `Export to A-Frame project`
+ Launch a local web server to test your WebVR page: there are several possibilities:
    + run the embedded server, click on the `Start Serving` button
    + run `live-server` under npm (install it with `npm install -g live-server`)
    + run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
+ Customize the 'index.html'-template in the Script-tab for future exports
+ Use `Custom Properties` of blender-objects to control tags/attributes ([example](https://gist.github.com/coderofsalvation/2468dc3dfbaca0520cd65c20dfad7eb8))

For massive exports, 'live-server' could be more useful because it can manage a content auto-refresh.

For further instructions, see the official [project page](https://silverslade.itch.io/a-frame-blender-exporter).

### Main UI configuration

Main Ui for the current version 0.0.7.
For a better usability, the add-on is divided into 6 main panels: 
+ A-frame
+ Renderer
+ Player
+ Interactive/action
+ Create Lightmaps
+ Exporter

### The Lightmapper Add-on

Since the 0.0.5+ version, the A-Frame Exporter will be compatible with the Lightmapper Add-on by Naxela.

The Lightmapper Add-on is an open source Blender Add-on project for an incredibly quick baking process: it uses the GPU and it can be configured to use a denoiser and an open CV module to clean the lightmaps. It can be much faster than the Blender Bake standard process.

To use the Lightmapper for baking lightmaps:

+ Install the Add-on from [Here](https://github.com/Naxela/The_Lightmapper)
+ Install and configure the denoise and opencv 
+ Untick the "Cast Shadows" option
+ Open the "Bake" panel and follow the enumerated buttons
+ 0 "Delete all Lightmaps"
+ 1 "Prepare Selection for Lightmapper"
+ 2 "Bake with Lightmapper" (wait the end of the process, better is toggle on Window -> System Console)
+ 3 "Save Lightmaps" (all lightmaps will be copied inside a "lightmaps" directory in the target project)
+ 4 "Clean Lightmaps" (it's needed because the changes to the shaders can be incompatible with A-Frame)
+ Then you can use Aframe exporter as usual - "Export A-Frame project" (it will load the saved lightmaps and it will apply them to the a frame component)
+ Remember to make backups. Often.

Though the process may seem quite rough, it works. In the future release I'll work for a more linear process.
But in few minutes you can enjoy a complex baked scene inside A-Frame with just few clicks.
